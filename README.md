# Fin

Fin is a 2D video game which is based on a game called "Omega" which in turn is
based on a game called "The End".

The aim of the game is to pilot a ship and defend yourself against enemy
spiders. The spiders will collect bricks from the bottom of the screen and
arrange them to spell the word "FIN". The game ends once all lives have been
lost or the word is completed.

To build the game, a [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) development environment
will be required. The Cargo tool will take care of downloading and compiling the
required Rust libraries. Also required to build the game are the SDL2 and
SDL2_mixer libraries. Thus far, it has only been tested on Debian Stretch.

The game is written in the Rust programming language and is built on top of the
[Piston](https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/piston) game engine.

The sounds have been sourced from [freesound.org](https://www.freesound.org/).

I am a Rust novice and it will show in the code. I also know very little about
modern graphics programming. Never mind, I have learned a little along the way.
